	<h3 class="block_9" id="calibre_link-17">Major update to Soundscape</h3>
	<p class="block_3">Soundscape have recently released a major update to their app. The update contains a new feature called routes, which lets you combine markers to create a route, and have Soundscape automatically guide you to the next marker once you reach the marker it is guiding you to. This may be useful for example on an unfamiliar route where you could put a marker at each corner and then combine them to create a route. It is also good as it means you don't have to keep switching between beacons along your route, as you can get everything set up before you go.<span class="calibre2">  </span>Routes can also be shared with people (e.g. your friend or mobility instructor).</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">To download the update, go to the App Store and search for "Microsoft Soundscape", then click the "Update" button.</p>

	<h2 id="calibre_link-3" class="block_8">2. Building an Accessible Advent Calendar</h2>
	<h2 class="block_7" id="calibre_link-19">&nbsp;</h2>
	<h3 id="calibre_link-10" class="block_9">Our journey to develop an accessible advent calendar for our readers</h3>
	<p class="block_3">Last year we had the idea of building an accessible advent calendar on our website. We thought it would be amazing to create the first online advent calendar designed specifically for young braillists. We only had this idea once December had already arrived, so we couldn't create anything for that year.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">So, this year, the story continues…</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">This year we were more prepared. We launched a beta version of our advent calendar, which is available now on our games website. It includes some Christmas jokes and also some audio files. We have also added a sound when a door opens, to give you confirmation that the door is open and that you can find out what's behind it.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We can confirm that the calendar is fully-accessible with a screen reader. If you find any accessibility bugs, please let us know.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Because this is a first test, not all days have content in them. There are also some features that we don't yet have, but are hoping to have ready in time for December 2022. These include automatically keeping doors open after the day has passed, and making it easier for non screen reader users to navigate.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you would like to check out the first version of the advent calendar and give us some feedback, just go to <a href="https://games.tactiletimes.org/advent.html" class="text_1">https://games.tactiletimes.org/advent.html</a> and then send any feedback to <a href="mailto:info@tactiletimes.org" class="text_1">info@tactiletimes.org</a>.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3"><a href="#calibre_link-1" class="text_1">Back to Contents</a></p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<h2 id="calibre_link-4" class="block_10">3. <span class="text_5">Remote learning could re-appear at any time! Are you ready?</span></h2>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">With the new Covid variant rapidly spreading, nobody knows what the situation will be like in January. Even if the overall guidance turns out to be to keep schools open, many schools, classes and year groups are likely going to have to isolate because of Covid outbreaks. Also, you may get Covid and find you have to suddenly switch to learning remotely.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">So here are 5 things that you could do to get ready:</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_11" id="calibre_link-20"><span class="bullet_">(i)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre5">Make a plan</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_3">The number one thing<span class="calibre2"> is for you and your parents to make sure that there is a plan for how you will receive your adapted work at home.  But there are also other things that you can do to prepare now.</span></p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_11" id="calibre_link-21"><span class="bullet_">(ii)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre5">Get ready for online meetings, and submitting work electronically</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_3">If you know which meeting platform (e.g. Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex) your school uses, double-check that you can independently join a meeting using that platform.<span class="calibre2">  </span>A simple test could be to ask your parents or a friend to create you a meeting, which you could then attempt to join.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If your school uses a system (such as Google Classroom) for you to submit work remotely, you should get comfortable using it now so it isn't a surprise to you if you have to stay at home.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Why not read up on your schools meeting platform on our <a href="https://tech.tactiletimes.org" class="text_1">tech blog</a> to get familiar with how it works? If your schools meeting platform isn't listed on our tech blog, try and search up some articles on how to join meetings with it.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you find there is an issue that cannot be easily solved, or that you are not able to join meetings, now is a good time to sort it out before it becomes urgent!</p>
	<h4 class="block_7">&nbsp;</h4>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_11" id="calibre_link-22"><span class="bullet_">(iii)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre5">Ask for your specialist Technology to come home</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_5">If you have tech (e.g. a Touch) that you only use in school and do not take home, you need to make sure you are allowed to bring this tech home if you have to learn remotely.</p>
	<p class="block_5">This will not be an issue for some people, but <span class="calibre6">we have heard that some children are not allowed to take their tech home.  I</span>f you <span class="calibre6">are one of these children then speak to your parents and QTVIs, as your tech can come home!  It is time to make this</span> change.</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you have an embosser at school and hardcopy braille really helps you, you should ask to take it home. If you don't know how to send documents to it yourself, you also need to learn how to do that.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_11" id="calibre_link-23"><span class="bullet_">(iv)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre5">Braille lessons at home</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_3">Get a Touch plus for remote braille lessons &ndash; With a touch plus, you can share your screen on Zoom. </p>
	<p class="block_3">You can use this feature along with KeyBRF so that you can have a productive braille lesson remotely where your braille teacher/QTVI can see braille you type come up on their device. You should ask for a Touch plus as soon as possible if you think this would make a big difference for you. </p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">You can achieve a similar result with a computer and Duxbury but it requires that you have a braille display, a Windows computer, JAWS, Duxbury, Zoom and a big chunk of time devoted to setup and testing. That is quite a long list of requirements!</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_11" id="calibre_link-24"><span class="bullet_">(v)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre5">Keep going outside</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">This one isn't really about tech, but we always recommend that you get some fresh air and do some outdoor exercise. Particularly during a lockdown when we might be at home all day, it is very important to schedule in time for exercise. You can also use Strava to track your exercise. See our review of Strava in issue 5 for more details, and get yourself set up now.</p>

	<h2 id="calibre_link-5" class="block_12">4. Tactile Times’ top tech tips</h2>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Here are our top tips to get the most out of tech, Christmas 2021.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_13"><span class="bullet_1">(i)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre7"> Are you struggling with an inaccessible app? Try button labelling! &ndash; VoiceOver on iPhones and iPads has a hidden feature that lets you label any button. This will work for items which announce themselves as something like "button" or "unlabelled button". It will not work for items you can't even navigate to using VoiceOver. To try this out, find out what the inaccessible button does either by trying it out or asking for help, and then double-tap and hold with two fingers until a label element alert appears. Enter a short, descriptive name for the button (e.g. Back, Next, Send, etc…) and then press enter.</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_13"><span class="bullet_1">(ii)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre7">Specialist input - If you would like to take tech to its full potential then there are consultant experts (such as TechVision, <a href="https://yourtechvision.com" class="calibre1"><span class="text_1">https://yourtechvision.com</span></a>) who can help you get the most out of tech. Your parents would need to pay for this, but it has been really helpful for me so it is worth finding out more if you need some help with tech, or you feel there is a gap in your knowledge that needs to be filled. Not all QTVIs are good at tech as it is so specialist and complex that it would be impossible for them all to know everything. To find out more contact us, and we can put you in touch.</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_13"><span class="bullet_1">(iii)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre7">Check your home WiFi speed &ndash; With your parents working from home and the possibility that you will have to isolate or learn from home, your WiFi might suddenly be put under bigger strain than usual. You should aim for a download speed of at least 20MBPS (20 megabytes per second) and an upload speed of at least 5 MBPS for two good-quality meetings at the same time. You can find out the speed you are currently getting by visiting <a href="https://speedsmart.net/start" class="text_1">https://speedsmart.net/start</a> while on your home WiFi. If your speed seems super slow, it may be time to ask your parents whether they would consider upgrading your WiFi.</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_13"><span class="bullet_1">(iv)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre7">To use almost all serious tech you need to be able to touch type. TypeAbility is a program where you can complete touch typing lessons from the very basics and locations of keys right up to using dialogues and checkboxes. TypeAbility is really accessible if you have the latest version of JAWS and is well worth the money. In the UK you can <a href="https://www.sightandsound.co.uk/product/typeability/" class="text_1">buy it from Sight and Sound</a>. If you need to learn how to touch type and use JAWS, it is definitely worth asking your parents or your school about getting it. There are lots of other touch typing apps with varying levels of accessibility, but I have found TypeAbility the most accessible.</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_13"><span class="bullet_1">(v)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre7">Check your Office version &ndash; Many people just think that Microsoft Office is Microsoft Office, but sadly they are wrong. There are several different versions, and some of them have different shortcuts and accessibility features than other ones. You can try to keep the same, up-to-date version (e.g. 2021) on all your computers but the easiest way to always make sure you have the latest accessible version everywhere is by using Microsoft 365. This way, your shortcuts will always remain the same, meaning you only have to learn one set. Some schools will give you a Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) license for <span class="calibre2">free,  and</span> some schools won't. Whichever way you get a license (whether you buy it yourself or get it through your school) you will be able to use it on up to 5 devices.</span></div>
</div>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<div class="calibre4">
	<div class="block_13"><span class="bullet_1">(vi)&nbsp;</span><span class="calibre7">Is your tech super locked down or restricted? Don't just give in. Some schools like to enable every restriction in the world on technology used by students. All schools will have a web filtering system (as giving students access to the entire internet isn't sensible), but restricting things which make no sense (such as WiFi settings or the file explorer) makes using tech much harder, particularly when using screen readers. If you think there are too many restrictions on your devices, ask your school for an explanation of why they are there and if there isn't one it might be time to request they are removed.</span></div>

	<h3 class="block_14" id="calibre_link-28">Sight Village</h3>
	<p class="block_3">Sight Village events are free-to-attend exhibitions where companies present the latest technology for blind people. They are really fun but can sometimes get a bit noisy. They are very helpful if you would like to try out a piece of tech to decide whether it is helpful for you or not.</p>
	<p class="block_2">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If the Covid situation allows, Sight Village are hoping to do in-person events in 2022. These will be taking place in different towns and cities throughout the country (with the biggest Central event taking place in Birmingham). See below for the dates of all the planned events.</p>
