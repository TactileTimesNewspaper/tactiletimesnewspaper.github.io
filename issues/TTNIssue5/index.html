	<p class="block_3">Welcome to the 5th edition of the Tactile Times! </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We are Ellie, Lexy and Theo, three young braillists who thought it would be fun to put together a way for children and young people who are braillists, to share news, event information, tips, opinions and ideas. We hope you like it. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We are really excited about the Tactile Times being a way for more and more of us braillists to keep each other up to date, so if you know someone else who might like to get a copy too, let us know!

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Thankyou to everyone that sent in articles, ideas and other contributions for this issue. We would love to include even more articles from our readers in the next issue! If there is something you really enjoy doing, or a place you had a good time visiting, why not write a short article about it for the Tactile Times? Or submit your favourite joke or recipe.

	<p class="block_3">We have a lot to share with you in this issue. From breaking news and upcoming events, to a delicious cupcake recipe and some exciting new games, there is bound to be something in this issue that you will enjoy.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Some navigation tips: We have put a line of 10 +’s between sections and == before each article so you can search for == to find the beginning of articles and +’s to find sections. This method is most useful on the Touch as it has no way to navigate by headings. Each section heading is also numbered so you can search for the number of a section followed by a full-stop to find that section.</p>
	<p class="block_3">We have also put headings in for sections and articles:</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 1: Title at the top of the document</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 2: Sections and contents page</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 3: Article titles</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 4: Article sections (not used in every article)</p>

	<h2 id="calibre_link-2" class="block_6">2. Fun Things we did</h2>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">A few of us went on the New College Wor<span class="calibre2">cester (NCW) Activity Break.  He</span>re’s what we thought:</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_9" id="calibre_link-19">== NCW Summer Activity break, by Zarie </h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The summer break at NCW allows young children to meet others and make friends with other children who have the same or similar issues to them given having no or little vision. I enjoyed baking, the pizza night and the barbecue. The best parts were the swimming and tandem riding. I thought these were very much suited for the hot weather in the summer. I loved a cool down in the pool. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I did not think there were a wide variety of lunches and did not enjoy them much. There were mainly wraps and sandwiches, which I thought weren't very healthy and, as I don't like these foods very much, I didn't think it was very fair that there weren't other options. I did however enjoy the breakfast. The toast was great and a wide variety of things to put on toast were offered. <span class="calibre2">  </span>I thought there were far too many sports activities, and since I don't like sport very much I did not enjoy this too much. I think the summer break should have more musical and creative activities. I was also far too tired to do so much sport and active things. I think that more breaks should have been offered. I shared a room with someone which helped me get to know someone else with a visual impairment as I was staying with them. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I would recommend the Activity Break to someone who is very active and needs some entertainment, perhaps someone who doesn't have many friends or whose parents are very boring or too busy to spend time with them. I would also recommend this to someone who wants to meet new people and make more friends. I would not recommend this to someone who does not want to participate in activities or who is very lazy. It is a great way for people to also build their confidence and social skills. Staying away from home was a challenge for me, but it can be done with so much support from helpful staff and other children.</p>

	<h3 class="block_9" id="calibre_link-21">== NCW Summer activity break, by Theo </h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I went to a Summer activity break at NCW this year. It was an exciting experience for me because I haven't done anything like it for a long time due to Covid.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Everyone was required to take a Covid test before they were allowed in. This made me feel confident about the fact that no-one had Covid.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_11">My best bits</h4>
	<p class="block_3">• Water sports - There was a trip on a mini bus to a huge lake where I did stand-up paddleboarding and kayaking. This was very exciting and it was the first time I did stand-up paddleboarding.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• The open mic - It was lovely to hear everyone’s talents and to perform in front of an audience again.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_11">The not so good bits</h4>
	<p class="block_3">• No tech sessions - Sadly, there were no sessions about tech. I would have liked to have some sessions about technology or a drop-in in the evening.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Very small lunches &ndash; I mentioned this last time, and sadly nothing much has changed.  They still only give you one sandwich for lunch. At least there were some vegetables this time.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_11">Some top tips</h4>
	<p class="block_3">• Orientate yourself - It was very important for me to orientate myself with my new setup (room, bathroom, toilet, etc...). It really helps to do this before your first night so you know where things are.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Leave time to rest - These camps are exciting but busy, so it is essential to leave some time in the evening to rest/calm down before going to sleep.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I would definitely recommend this camp to anyone looking for an opportunity to take the next step towards their independence and have lots of fun along the way.</p>

	<h3 class="block_9" id="calibre_link-22">== NCW Activity break, by Alex</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We asked a couple of other people who attended the break their best and worst part of it, a top tip for anyone who was attending it next year, and whether they would recommend it to other braillists. Here are the results:</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">My best bits for the NCW summer camp was most of the activities during the day and the bingo evening, and my worst bits of the camp I would say the swimming as I’m not a fan of swimming at all<span class="calibre2">.  Also, there an occasion when</span> another camper kept shouting and t<span class="calibre2">rying to touch me and my friend, which I didn’t like much.  My top tip </span>for the trip would be to make friends during the icebreakers and to have fun and I would recommend to go especially if the trip was a bit longer. </p>

	<p class="block_3">The best part of NCW for me was making lots of new VI friend<span class="calibre2">s.  T</span>he worst part was doing the independent living skills which I found very annoying.  My top tip would be to talk to as many people as possible, and I would definitely go back.  </p>

	<p class="block_3">If you have used multiple languages with JAWS before, you know how fiddly it is.</p>
	<p class="block_3">To switch languages you currently have to open Settings Centre and change a few settings.<span class="calibre2">  </span>This is very inconvenient if you have a French lesson at school, and even more inconvenient if you have a document containing two or more languages (like a PowerPoint for a French lesson) as you can't just press a single key to change languages like on the Touch.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you need to be able to switch between languages on the Touch, then you need to create language profiles.</p>

	<ol class="list_">
	<li class="block_13">Press Space+O to open the Options menu.</li>
	<li class="block_13">Find the Configure language profiles option and select it.</li>
	<li class="block_13">A list of profiles will come up. Press Space until you reach Add additional language profile, then select it.</li>
	<li class="block_13">It will prompt you for a profile name. I normally enter the name of the language or braille grade.</li>
	<li class="block_13">A configuration options screen will appear. The important setting to change here is Literary braille table. You need to change it to your chosen language. Unless you want contracted braille in that language, you need to change this to that language's Grade 1 braille table. You might need to play around with the setting until something works if the options are not clear.</li>
	<li class="block_13">You can also change the voice if you will be using speech with this language profile.</li>
	<li class="block_13">You are now done, press Space+E to exit.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_14">You can now press Enter+L to quickly switch profiles.</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">You can quickly add more braille tables in VoiceOver settings.</p>

	<h3 class="block_9" id="calibre_link-32">== How I compose music </h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">As well as playing the piano and learning braille music, another skill I'm learning is composition. It's good practice especially for a levels. </p>

	<p class="block_3">MuseScore </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">MuseScore helps me write out notes so others can see them. It is an application you can download on the laptop with the screen reader NVDA. The notes are typed just like the letters on the laptop whilst the numbers represent the value of notes. There are also some places which you can go into that write in things like dynamics and articulation. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Overall I've found MuseScore really helpful even though it may freeze from time to time. It's good to be able to transfer between the piano and the laptop inputting notes into MuseScore. I hope to improve a lot more with MuseScore in the future so I can add lots of new touches to my pieces, like lots of trills for decoration. </p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_15">WiFi connectivity is a vital component of the Touch + and it is important to be able to search for and connect to WiFi networks yourself.</p>
	<p class="block_15">First of all, <span class="calibre2">you need to open the WiFi menu.  </span>To do this:<br class="calibre6" />• Press Space+O to open the Options menu.<br class="calibre6" />• Press the letter A until you reach Android system settings, then press Enter.<br class="calibre6" />• Press space until you see Network and internet, and then press Enter<br class="calibre6" />• Press space ntil you find the WiFi option and click on it.</p>
	<p class="block_15">Once you are in the WiFi settings menu you can join and forget networ<span class="calibre2">ks and change your preferences.  </span>To join a network, press Enter on it. Enter the security information for the network if needed (e.g. password) and then click Connect. </p>
	<p class="block_15">If the network has a login page, you will see a notification.<span class="calibre2">  </span>Press Enter+N to open the notification centre and then find the Android System. Sign in to WiFi notification. You can click on this to launch the login page.</p>
	<p class="block_15">You can view all saved networks from the saved networks option <span class="calibre2">at the bottom of the WiFi menu.  </span>You can also quickly view connection status by pressing Enter+Dots 3 and 4 at any time.</p>
	<h3 id="calibre_link-14" class="block_9">== Humanware’s new Brailliant BI 40X </h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I have recently got a new Brailliant BI 40X braille display. <span class="calibre2">It’s quite exciting, as it’s the most advanced braille display there is right now.  A full revi</span>ew will follow in a later issue, but here are some things that readers might find useful to know sooner.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The commands are quite similar to the <span class="calibre2">Braillenote Touch commands.  So, if you know your way around the Touch, then you will be able to </span>quickly familiarize yourself with the menus and options available. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">There is an editor which you can use to write quick notes in Plain text format. This is useful if you need to start writing quickly &ndash; eg at the beginning of a lesson if your computer is not set up yet. You can then copy these notes to your computer.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The calculator is computer braille only so it’s not worth using, as there is no point learning Maths in computer braille just to use a calculator.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Most useful to know is that there is bug when you try and add your phone as a Bluetooth device.<span class="calibre2">  The connection is currently very unreliable.</span><span class="calibre2">  </span>But, thanks to the Brailliant BI X users list, I discovered that you have to turn WiFi off on the Brailliant to have a reliable Bluetooth connection.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">There is another update coming out soon so hopefully this workaround will no longer be needed, but here are the steps to turn WiFi off:</p>
	<p class="block_3">1. Press space+O to open the Options menu.</p>
	<p class="block_3">2. Press w for WiFi and then press enter.</p>
	<p class="block_3">3. Press space until "wifi on" appears and press enter.</p>
	<p class="block_3">4. It should now say wifi off.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">WiFi is needed for updates and online books, but you can always turn it on if you need it.</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I attended a Goallall UK camp at the end of July, and I really enjoyed it. Here are some things which were great, and some things which could have been better.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_11">Things I enjoyed:</h4>
	<p class="block_3">• Improving my Goalball skills - Having a few days focused on goalball helped me to improve my technique.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Playing goalball with children from all around the country</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Getting lots of practice at penalties and how best to defend them. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_11">Things which could be better:</h4>
	<p class="block_3">• You could sometimes hear a goalball in the sports hall next door which was distracting during a game.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• No reliable WiFi - The WiFi in the hotel was very unreliable and the 4G signal and speed was also poor. There was good WiFi in the sports hall but no phones were allowed during the day so there was not much time where a reliable internet connection was possible. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_9" id="calibre_link-41">== Top tips when attending a Goalball UK Summer camp</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Here are some top tips that will help you have the best time.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Bring lots of water - Playing goalball is very thirsty work, particularly in a hot sports hall. You may only be able to refill your water bottle at certain times of day, so make sure you fill it up in the morning where you are staying.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Bring your own snacks - The food which was provided was good, but no snacks were provided in between meals. It was recommended that you should bring your own snacks, and eating some snacks during the small breaks helped keep me going.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Bring the right kit - Playing goalball for 5 hours or more per day in the wrong kit is quite uncomfortable. Make sure that you have the correct kit so that you can be comfortable during the day.</p>
	<p class="block_3">• Bring a towel - Towels were provided at the hotel, but not in the changing rooms. If you would like to be able to shower when you change, you will need to bring a towel with from your room or pack one before you leave.</p>

	<p class="block_3">As the evenings get darker and you maybe find yourself indoors a bit more, how about having a go at drawing using a Perkins Brailler? </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Maybe you thought a Perkins was just for writing and maths? Not at all! The only limit is your imagination. To get you started we have included a set of instructions that you can follow, using a Perkins brailler and landscape A4 or large size braille paper to make a really cool braille picture of a Jack-o-lantern. Just in time for Halloween! </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">You could try brailling the picture onto A4 orange card and then cutting it out and sticking it onto contrasting black card to make a fantastic feeling and looking Halloween card for a friend or family member. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If Halloween is not your thing,  here is a link to instructions for a Braille Birthday cake picture too. </p>
