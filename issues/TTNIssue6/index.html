	<p class="block_3">Welcome to the 6<sup class="calibre2">th</sup> edition of the Tactile Times! </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We are Ellie, Lexy and Theo, three young braillists who thought it would be fun to put together a way for children and young people who are braillists, to share news, event information, tips, opinions and ideas. We hope you like it. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We are really excited about the Tactile Times being a way for more and more of us braillists to keep each other up to date, so if you know someone else who might like to get a copy, or to contribute an article, then let us know!  To find out more about the Tactile Times and why we set it up, visit <a href="https://tactiletimes.org/about" class="text_">https://tactiletimes.org/about</a> And you can find more ideas for what to contribute and some accessibility tips at <a href="https://tactiletimes.org/contribute" class="text_">https://tactiletimes.org/contribute</a></p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">This issue is filled with breaking news, technology reviews, recommended sports activities and much, much more, and we hope that you really enjoy reading it.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Best wishes from all of us at the Tactile Times and wishing you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Some navigation tips: We have put a line of 10 +’s between sections and == before each article so you can search for == to find the beginning of articles and +’s to find sections. This method is most useful on devices that cannot navigate by headings (such as Braille displays). On the Touch +, you can navigate by heading by either pressing Enter+V to open the KeyWord preview or reading this issue via the online version. Each section heading is also numbered so you can search for the number of a section followed by a full-stop to find that section.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We have also put headings in for sections and articles:</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 1: Title at the top of the document</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 2: Sections and contents page</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 3: Article titles</p>
	<p class="block_3">Heading 4: Article sections (not used in every article)</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you are eagerly awaiting the arrival of a tactile graphics display, we have some good news!</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Within the last few months, two new prototypes (the Graphiti+ by Orbit Research and the Dot Pad by Dot Inc.) have been launched and <a href="https://www.aph.org/aph-is-ready-for-a-braille-revolution/" class="text_">APH also appear to be working with HumanWare on a competitor</a>.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Sadly it is very difficult to get your hands on any of these devices in the UK at the moment as they did not come to Sight Village and have only been demonstrated in the U.S., but you can find more information about them below.</p>
	<p class="block_3"><a href="http://www.orbitresearch.com/product/graphiti-plus/" class="calibre3"><span class="text_">Graphiti Plus</span></a></p>
	<p class="block_3"><a href="https://pad.dotincorp.com/" class="text_">DotPad</a></p>
	<p class="block_3">On a related note, Bristol Braille have also launched the Canute Console. See <a href="#calibre_link-13" class="text_">below</a> for details.</p>

	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-22">== APH partners with the Daisy Consortium to develop the EBRF</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_7">APH (the American Printing House for the Blind, based in the US), has announced that it has partnered with the Daisy Consortium to begin development on a brand-new type of file called the EBRF.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_7">The file format is looking like it will be the next-generation for BRF’s, with support for tactile graphics, headings and more.</p>
	<p class="block_7">See the full announcement here:</p>
	<p class="block_7"><a href="https://www.aph.org/aph-partners-with-daisy-consortium-on-new-digital-braille-standard/" class="text_">https://www.aph.org/aph-partners-with-daisy-consortium-on-new-digital-braille-standard/</a></p>

	<h3 id="calibre_link-14" class="block_6">== A sad time for Microsoft Soundscape</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">On the 12<sup class="calibre2">th</sup> of December this year, Microsoft announced that the Soundscape app will be discontinued and gave everyone only 3 more weeks to download it.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The iPhone app was very helpful for navigating new environments, and it also contained spatial audio queues. You could set a beacon for a destination to navigate yourself there, and even create your own markers. These were all very unique features. No other app can do this, or even comes close to what Soundscape did.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">On the 3<sup class="calibre2">rd</sup> of January 2023, the app will be pulled from the App Store and made open source. This essentially means all new downloads are blocked, but the code is out there. The most we can hope for is for someone to pick up the code and make a new app from it if we’re lucky.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">So download it right now if you don’t already have it and would like to try it out before existing installations are deactivated in June.<span class="calibre1">  </span>Let’s just hope that Seeing AI isn’t n<span class="calibre1">ext in line for the chop.  </span>See the full announcement here: <a href="https://aka.ms/ossblog" class="text_">https://aka.ms/ossblog</a></p>

	<p class="block_3">HumanWare’s new Brailliant BI 40X braille displays, which came out in December 2020, have now received a major update which unlocks text-to-speech capabilities for the displays.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">They have also received numerous new features over the last few months, including a BRF Editor and several new settings.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">You can find instructions to get speech working here:</p>

	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-24">== JAWS 2023 released</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">A new major version of JAWS has just released, and it is well worth the upgrade. From brand-new features like Smart glance to help you navigate the internet, to a whole array of bug fixes and enhancements, there is surely something for everyone to benefit from in this update.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">To install it, first check with whoever provides your JAWS license if you’re license includes the upgrade. If it does, just navigate to the Check for updates menu in JAWS (on school computers school IT may need to do this and enter a special password) and then the update will download and install.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Once installed, why not read the full release notes in JAWS menu &gt; Help &gt; What’s new?</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-25">== New update to the Concept2 ErgData app makes it more accessible</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Normally app updates are a nightmare for accessibility, but Concept2 has partnered with the ACB (American Council of the Blind) to ensure their app remains accessible after a major visual overhaul. So, if you were holding back on this update, you can click “Update” knowing that the app will still work for you after you do.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-26">== New Soundscape competitor launches on the App Store</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Up until now, Soundscape has been the only spatial audio navigation app available, but that will soon change. There is now another app entering the scene, likely trying to fill the gap that <a href="#calibre_link-14" class="text_">Soundscape’s exit</a> will create. </p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">It is in Alpha and you can try it out right now by downloading “WaveOut” from the iOS App Store.<span class="calibre1">  </span>More information about the new app can be found at <a href="https://waveout.app" class="text_">https://waveout.app</a></p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 id="calibre_link-13" class="block_6">== Bristol Braille launch the Canute console</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Bristol Braille Technology, the makers of the Canute multi-line braille display with 9 lines and 360 cells in total, have launched a very exciting new product, the Canute console.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The original Canute could only handle BRF’s on USB, while the Canute console makes games, word-processing, spreadsheets and even more possible.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Bristol Braille have been taking it on tour in November and they plan to continue the tour, see their website (<a href="https://www.bristolbraille.org" class="text_">https://www.bristolbraille.org</a>) for tour dates. Also, see below for <a href="#calibre_link-15" class="text_">my first impressions of the product</a>.</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you’re interested in sport, you might be excited to hear that the IBSA championships (which specifically include blind sports) will be coming to Birmingham in the UK in late August next year. If you have been looking for a chance to watch some professional blind sport, why not come and watch?</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-28">== KeyCode for BrailleNote Touch + has launched</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">HumanWare, the manufacturer of the BrailleNote Touch +, have launched KeyCoad (a new braille-centric coding application which can help you learn coding with just a Touch + and a micro:bit).</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Although the app’s features are fairly limited, it is definitely worth a look if you’re new to coding and not confident on the computer yet. However, buying a Touch + purely for this app is likely not the best idea.</p>
	<p class="block_3">To download it, just <a href="#calibre_link-16" class="text_">update your Touch +</a>. See <a href="https://www.humanware.ca/web/en/newsletter/151120220926-BNT-KeyCode.htm" class="text_">this HumanWare page</a> for more information.</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">We are very excited to launch the Tactile Times shortcut, which gives you fast access to everything we have to offer across iPhone, iPad, and even Apple Watch!</p>
	<p class="block_3">It lets you quickly download issues for later, read the latest updates from us or play a quick round of Hangman, all in one place.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The shortcut has a simple main menu, where you select what you would like to do. It also has clear sounds to let you know when it is opened or closed.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you would like to install it, just head to <a href="https://tactiletimes.org/shortcut" class="text_">https://tactiletimes.org/shortcut</a></p>

	<li class="block_9">350 grams chopped dark chocolate (minimum 70% coco solids)</li>
	<li class="block_10">1 × 397 grams can of condensed milk</li>
	<li class="block_10">30 grams butter</li>
	<li class="block_10">Pinch of salt</li>
	<li class="block_10">150 grams pistachios</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_11">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Method</h4>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_12">Put the chopped chocolate, condensed milk, butter and salt in a heavy-based pan on a low heat, and stir to melt.</li>
	<li class="block_12">Put the nuts into a freezer bag and bash them with a rolling pin, until broken up into both big and little pieces.</li>
	<li class="block_12">Add the nuts to the melted chocolate and condensed milk and stir well to mix.</li>
	<li class="block_12">Pour and spatch this mixture into a foil tray 23cm / 9 inch square, smoothing the top.</li>
	<li class="block_12">Let the fudge cool, and refrigerate until set. You can then cut it into small pieces. You can best achieve this by cutting the fudge so that you get 8 rows across and 8 rows lengthways, and this should give 64 pieces, each approx. 2.75cm / 1⅛ inches square.</li>
	<li class="block_12">Once cut, it can be kept in the freezer &mdash; no need to thaw just eat straight away.</li>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Duolingo have recently made some major changes to how their app works on iOS. This includes moving around tabs, changing where things are and the renaming of some features, for example the Duolingo Plus subscription has been renamed Super Duolingo.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">This seems quite annoying to me, as I had only just got used to the complicated layout in the first place. Also, it seems the amount of things that gems (the virtual currency you earn in the app) can be spent on is slowly but surely decreasing.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Nevertheless, Duolingo is still a great language learning app, and I encourage anyone new to it to give it a try, you can even complete your first lesson without an account.</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">For any Touch+ users learning a language at school, we have some good news.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The type of braille used by foreign-language learners in the UK (a variant of uncontracted UEB containing accents), has previously been unavailable for electronic use.<span class="calibre1">  </span>It is now available on the Touch+.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you would like to have a go with it, first make sure you are updated (we have a guide on this in <a href="#calibre_link-17" class="text_">the tech section</a>).</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">To add it to your existing Language profile, access the options menu with Space+O, select Configure language profiles and then the name of your profile and then select the corresponding Method 2 table from, slightly counterintuitively, the English UEB menu (HumanWare have a helpful YouTube tutorial on this).</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">You can also add it to a new language profile with similar steps.</p>
	<p class="block_3">For me it has got some getting used to as I have used French and German in Grade 1 form but with foreign punctuation, but it is well worth it.</p>

	<h3 id="calibre_link-17" class="block_6">== How to update a BrailleNote Touch + or Brailliant</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">When updates come out for your devices, you will likely be very excited. Here is how to get the updates downloaded.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Before you start</h4>
	<p class="block_3">We know that you will naturally be very excited, but you really shouldn’t update if:</p>
	<ul class="list_">
	<li class="block_9">You are in the middle of, or are about to start, a set of exams</li>
	<li class="block_10">Your school IT department or QTVI told you to hold off on the update</li>
	<li class="block_10">The update has been reported unstable by lots of users.</li>
</ul>
	<p class="block_13">We know that sometimes you just can’t wait to get your hands on the update, but if any of these three points apply to you there is a good reason to hold off.</p>
	<p class="block_11">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_13">If you shouldn’t be updating or don’t want to, turn off Automatic updates. On the Touch+ simply open the KeyUpdater app from the All Apps menu to do this, and them turn them off under preferences. Brailliants aren’t going to do full updates automatically, but you may wish to turn off “automatic check” under Space+O &gt; Software Update to prevent constant nagging about updates.</p>
	<p class="block_11">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_13">If none of these three points apply to you, let’s run through how to update</p>
	<p class="block_11">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 id="calibre_link-16" class="block_8">BrailleNote Touch +</h4>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The below instructions are for the BrailleNote Touch + only. The original touch does not get updates anymore, in fact not even security patches.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">If you see an alert saying an update is ready to be installed, just select “Install” and let the device update automatically.</p>
	<p class="block_3">If not, manually update by:</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_9">Use Space+Dots456 to go to the bottom of the Main menu. You should be placed on “All applications”.</li>
	<li class="block_10">Press Enter to select this.</li>
	<li class="block_10">Press the letter K as many times as needed until “KeyUpdater” is shown.</li>
	<li class="block_10">Press enter to open the app.</li>
	<li class="block_10">Select “Application updates” and then select “Install” if needed.</li>
	<li class="block_10">Wait for the Update to complete.</li>
</ol>
	<p class="block_11">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Brailliant BI 40X</h4>
	<p class="block_3">The new Brailliant BI 40X series of braille displays are currently receiving regular updates.</p>
	<p class="block_3">To update your braille display:</p>
	<ol class="list_1">
	<li class="block_9">Press Space+O to open the options menu</li>
	<li class="block_10">First, select “WiFi” and check you are connected to a network. If not, connect to one. If there is no network available to you, you can use your phone hotspot.</li>
	<li class="block_10">Exit the WiFi menu to go back to the options menu.</li>
	<li class="block_10">Select “Software update” and then select “Check for update”.</li>
	<li class="block_14">The braille display will install an update if available. Wait for the process to complete.</li>
</ol>

	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-40">== Sight Village Central 2022</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I attended Sight Village on Wednesday 29<sup class="calibre2">th</sup> June 2022 in Solihull. I got permission to miss school to go, which was really fun.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Sight Village is a great event where you can get your hands on the latest blind tech and try it out.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I definitely recommend that you ask your school for permission to attend next year, as it is a great event which I think young braillists are missing out on.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Here are some of my experiences from the event.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Hable One</h4>
	<p class="block_3">Three different stands were all showcasing a new, compact device called the Hable One. It is a new way to input braille into a phone or computer, and also control iPhones and Android phones.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">You hold it in your hand like a game controller (different to how you would hold a braille display). I had a go with it and it inputted text very well.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Braille Sense 6</h4>
	<p class="block_3">Sight and Sound had the Braille Sense 6 on their stand. Although this was on Android 10 (two versions more recent than the Touch +) there is no particular reason why it won’t just be left behind and not able to access any Android updates like all the other Android braille notetakers released before it. I found there were quite a lot of complex menus to get lost in and a lot more keys on the front of it, but that may just be because I am used to the Touch.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">HumanWare Stand and presentation</h4>
	<p class="block_3">It was an enjoyable experience to visit Andrew and Martin at the HumanWare stand. Although lots of the tech they had there was already familiar to me, it was still a fun visit. Andrew did a presentation about coding and after it I got to have a quick go with KeyCode (a coding app coming to the Touch + in the September update). The app can flash code to a micro:bit, but sadly can’t run code directly. After 5 minutes of use I had already found a bug, but that was expected as it is not ready for release yet.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Computer Room Services</h4>
	<p class="block_3">As usual, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Steve’s table full to the brim with accessible tech. This year, he had the new Daisy player, an accessible MP3 player, navigation devices, and a lot more on display. He even brought his very own Wi-Fi network with him!</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Sadly, the accessible vibrating power pack (which I have at home and really like) is out of stock but it sounds like a new version of it is being developed.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Amazon Echo</h4>
	<p class="block_3">I visited the Alexa stand quite late on in the day. I was excited about their new feature that recognised things you were holding, but sadly the technology behind it got mixed up and started reading out nonsense from my T-shirt. Hopelly this tech will improve in the future.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I visited several more stands, but listing them all here would take up too much space.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Hopefully, that gives you a good overview of the latest in blind tech and what to expect if you ever visit Sight Village yourself.</p>

	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-41">== How AirTags can help you find your things</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Apple has now launched AirTags, which are essentially Bluetooth trackers that you can attach to various items to find them using your iPhone. They are round and roughly the size of a 2p coin, but thicker.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">At first glance, there may be no immediate visible differences compared to Tile and other competitors, but AirTags have a couple of features that make them more useful.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">More precise finding</h4>
	<p class="block_3">If you have a supported iPhone, you can find your AirTags using a new technology called Ultra wide band. This means that VoiceOver can say “5 metres to your left” or “2 metres behind you”. This is extremely helpful to find the exact location of the Air Tag if you cannot hear the quiet sound it makes.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">To try this out, just go to the “Items” tab in the Find My app and then select the name you gave the Air Tag followed by the “Find” button. Just make sure you have your phone pointing in the same direction you are facing.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">More devices to report lost items</h4>
	<p class="block_3">The concept of Bluetooth trackers only works if you have a large number of users who can automatically report the location of an item if it is lost. AirTags rely on built-in features of more than a billion iPhones around the world for this, so there are lots of devices that will report your Air Tag’s location if it gets lost.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-42">== Top tips for using multiple GPS apps together</h3>
	<p class="block_3">It is rare that you will be able to find a navigation/GPS app which is perfect for everything, so you may end up using two, or even three, of these apps at the same time. Here are my top tips for anyone considering to do this.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Set different voices for each app</h4>
	<p class="block_3">If multiple apps are going to talk to you at the same time, you need to be able to easily tell the difference between them.</p>
	<p class="block_3">You should have a look in the settings of your app and change one of the voices from the default one. One with a female voice and the other with a male voice will provide the biggest contrast.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Bring a power pack</h4>
	<p class="block_3">One GPS app alone can eat through your phone battery very quickly, and so multiple ones can eat through it even faster.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Make sure you have a power pack or other way to charge your phone if it is about to run out.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Close any navigation or GPS apps you aren’t actively using</h4>
	<p class="block_3">Most iPhone apps can be left open in the app switcher for months, or even years, with little consequences to battery life.<span class="calibre1">  </span>However, navigation and GPS apps, particularly ones designed for blind people that aren’t widely used, are an important exception.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">These apps should be closed using the app switcher when not actively in use. It is quick to ask Siri to open them or find them on the Home screen again when you need them.<span class="calibre1">  </span>To access the app switcher press the home button twice quickly if you have one, and if not swipe up from the bottom of the screen until you have heard three clicks in a row increasing in pitch.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">To close an app while focused on it in the app switcher, swipe up with three fingers or use the “Close” action by swiping up/down until you find it once the rotor is set to “Actions”.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">It sounds complicated, but you will get used to it if you practice enough.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Download offline maps if available</h4>
	<p class="block_3">Mobile signal isn’t perfect everywhere, and you may find yourself in a tricky situation if an app you rely on unexpectedly goes offline.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">In Google Maps, you can download entire areas for offline use. We recommend you do this while on a WiFi network so you don’t accidentally use up all your data.</p>
	<p class="block_3">In Soundscape, key places should be set as markers, as these can be navigated to offline if needed.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-43">== iOS 16 &ndash; Should you update or wait?</h3>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Apple has now released iOS 16 to the public, and you are likely itching to get your hands on the newest release of iOS. But is it a good idea to download it if you use VoiceOver?</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I have done some testing to find out.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Upsides:</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Lock screen widgets</h4>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">One of the biggest features of iOS 16 is the ability to totally customize your lock screen by adding widgets, photos and more. This is a really great feature, as you can see the latest weather forecasts or the top items on your homework list without even unlocking your phone (although I don’t know if I want my homework list sitting on my lock screen!).</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Show Wi-Fi passwords in the Settings app</h4>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Have you forgotten your long, complicated home Wi-Fi password yet again? With iOS 16 you no longer need to find a safe and secure place to put a braille or electronic copy, you can just view it right in the Settings app. The feature is completely secure too, you just tap on the Password field on the network info page and you will be prompted for Face <span class="calibre1">ID,  Touch</span> ID or your passcode before being allowed access to the password.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Downsides:</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Distorted VoiceOver voices</h4>
	<p class="block_3">When using the default Daniel voice installed with iOS, it puts a strange emphasis on the end of a sentence or line. This seems like a strange bug to be caused by an update, but it really does happen.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h4 class="block_8">Safari toolbar keeps collapsing while browsing</h4>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">One of the most annoying bugs is that the toolbar in Safari (with “Back”, “Forward”, “Share”, etc…) will auto-collapse while browsing. This is really annoying, as if you want to go back to the previous page you first have to use your finger to find the address bar on the screen and then double-tap it.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">These are only a couple of the upsides and downsides, you can find plenty more bugs on <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/accessibility-bugs-introduced-resolved-ios-16-blind-low-vision-users" class="calibre3"><span class="text_">AppleVis’s list</span></a> and plenty more reasons to upgrade on the Apple website.</p>
	<p class="block_3">So, the decision is up to you, but make sure to think carefully before clicking that “Update” button, as once you’ve updated, there’s no going back.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 class="block_6" id="calibre_link-44">== The Tech-VI announcement list</h3>
	<p class="block_3">I recently became aware of  an announcement-only mailing list devoted purely to assistive tech for blind people.<span class="calibre1">  </span>Although the list is ran from America, it still has plenty of useful information sent around that has been interesting to me (I attended a webinar about accessible textbooks sent to the list the very day I subscribed).</p>
	<p class="block_3">Although there are a fair few emails a day, you can opt for a daily/weekly digest instead.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The list is particularly great as the subject lines are always descriptive and clear (with the added bonus of a constant prefix which is helpful for email sorting rules) and the entire article being mentioned is always included in the main body of the email if possible.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">You can find the list page at:<span class="calibre1">  </span><a href="https://groups.io/g/tech-vi" class="text_">https://groups.io/g/tech-vi</a></p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">There are also several other extremely helpful email groups for users of specific pieces of assistive technology and more general ones too, more information to come in the next issue!</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 id="calibre_link-15" class="block_6">== My first impressions of the Canute console</h3>
	<p class="block_3">I was very lucky to have the opportunity to come and see the Canute console on tour in London in the evening of Wednesday 16<sup class="calibre2">th</sup> November.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">Although all I really got was a first glimpse of the device, it was still very exciting.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The centre piece of the new console is the Canute multi-<span class="calibre1">line  braille</span> display, which appears to slot into some kind of dock. There is a keyboard integrated into the dock which slides out from underneath, and a laptop-style screen positioned above the Canute (imagining the Canute was the keyboard of a laptop).</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">While the original Canute was only capable of reading specially-formatted braille files from Duxbury, the new prototype of the Canute console can display Python code, and run it as well.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">After reading through the code behind a Snake game, I was able to have a go at playing the game. I have never been able to play Snake before due to its graphical design, so this was an amazing experience. There was a braille “for” sign which moved around the screen (controlled by the arrow keys) and you had to position it on top of the braille letters to eat them and win the game.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">So in conclusion I think that the Canute console is really cool and a massive leap forward from the original Canute.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">I got the chance to visit the Olympic velodrome (called the Lee Valley Velo-Park) in Stratford in October half term.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">It was really good fun. I was attending a special session they run there once every month for blind athletes and athletes with other disabilities. They organised finding a pilot for me to ride a tandem with which meant you didn’t have to source one yourself.</p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="block_3">The experience was really amazing (particularly my fastest 18.1-second lap) and I encourage other blind people to give it a try.</p>

	<h4 class="block_8">Making Your Cinnamon Apple Ornaments</h4>
	<ul class="list_">
	<li class="block_30">Mix the 1 mug of applesauce and the mug of cinnamon in a bowl. You may need to add a bit more cinnamon, depending on the consistency of the applesauce brand you use. If you run out of cinnamon, a little whole wheat flour works well, too.</li>
</ul>
	<ul class="list_">
	<li class="block_30">Combine the applesauce and cinnamon until it is the consistency of cookie dough; not too wet, but not crumbly either. You will have to get your hands in there to really get it all mixed up. </li>
</ul>
	<ul class="list_">
	<li class="block_30">Sprinkle some cinnamon or whole wheat flour on your working surface and lay your dough out for rolling. This dough actually rolls fairly easily, but you can wrap your rolling pin in parchment paper to reduce stickiness if you wish. </li>
	<li class="block_30">Roll to the dough out to about half a cm thickness</li>
</ul>
	<ul class="list_">
	<li class="block_30">Use cookie cutters to cut out your ornaments (we love star shapes here!) and lay them on a parchment lined baking tray. </li>
	<li class="block_30">Once all your ornaments are on the cookie sheet, use a straw to make holes in the top of each ornament. </li>
</ul>
	<ul class="list_">
	<li class="block_30">Then if adding braille, use a toothpick to make little 6-dot braille cells on each ornament so that you can place cloves there to make braille letters. </li>
	<li class="block_30">Make your letters using cloves or edible silver balls. You will have to trim the ends off your cloves to make them fit</li>
	<li class="block_28">You can just leave your ornaments out to dry for 24 to 48 hours, which we would recommend if you use<span class="calibre1"> the silver balls to decorate. But you can also bake them at 200° for 1 hour.  The ornaments do seem to be a bit stronger after baking.</span></li>
	<li class="block_30">Let your ornaments cool, then string them with pretty ribbons or string. </li>
	<li class="block_30">Hang them on your tree or around the house, they will smell gorgeous!</li>
	<li class="block_30">The cloves work well for the braille because they smell nice, they are very tactile and they handle the baking without melting… but they aren’t very high contrast, the silver balls are a better contrast so just choose whatever you prefer. </li>
