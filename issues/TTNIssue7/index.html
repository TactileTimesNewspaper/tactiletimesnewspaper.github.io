	<h3 id="calibre_link-1" class="block_10">== Braille Creative writing contest - Canadian National Institute for the Blind </h3>
	<p class="block_3"><span class="calibre1">Are you interested in creative writing?  Would you like to get recognised for your work?  The CNIB have just launched their creative writing contest, </span><span class="calibre1">and this year it’s open to UK entries too.  </span></p>
	<p class="block_3">The competition is now open to primary and secondary students in the UK, and you’ll need to write a short story, essay or poem in hard copy braille<span class="calibre1">.  There are lots of cash prizes!!  S</span>o why not get writing?!</p>
	<p class="block_3">The deadline is the end of May so this is probably more for people without exams.</p>
	<p class="block_3">More info at <a href="https://www.victa.org.uk/victa-calendar/braille-creative-writing-contest/" class="text_">https://www.victa.org.uk/victa-calendar/braille-creative-writing-contest/</a> </p>
	<p class="block_3">P.S. If you write something, send it to us too, and have it published in the next edition of the TTN (contributions can be sent to: <a href="mailto:info@tactiletimes.org" class="text_">info@tactiletimes.org</a><span class="text_">).</span></p>
	<p class="block_1">&nbsp;</p>
	<h3 id="calibre_link-2" class="block_10">== The Tactile Times launches Accessible Quizlet Viewer!</h3>
	<p class="block_3">Have you heard of Quizlet? If so, it's probably not in a good way as we've found it incredibly inaccessible.</p>
	<p class="block_3">The core functionality of Quizlet is to help you revise words using all sorts of methods which are great for sighted people, but what about blind people? Until now they've missed out, but today that is changing.</p>
	<p class="block_3">You can have a go making your favourite Quizlet set accessible at:</p>
	<p class="block_3"><a href="https://quizlet.tactiletimes.org" class="text_">https://quizlet.tactiletimes.org</a></p>
	<p class="block_3">Your Quizlet will open in a fully-accessible table with correct language tagging - more details at the link above.</p>
	<p class="block_3">Please note that this is still in the testing phase, and we rely on a fairly complex system for importing new Quizlet sets and making them accessible, so there may be times when the service for adding new Quizlet sets is temporarily down. If this happens please bear with us as we work to get it back up and running as quickly as we can. And, by the way, please do send us any feedback too.</p>
	<h3 class="block_9" id="calibre_link-12">&nbsp;</h3>
	<h3 id="calibre_link-6" class="block_10">== Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)</h3>

	<p class="block_3"><span class="calibre1">It was co-founded by Jennison Asuncion, who’s a bit of a legend in the blind tech accessibility world.  </span>There are lots of interesting events, all over the world. You’ll have to hunt through to find one you like.</p>
	<p class="block_3">You might be interested in the event Sight and Sound are doing in partnership with the BATA at 12:30 pm that day tackling accessibility of financial services.
