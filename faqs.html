>fantasy football</a> area of this website.

Why do we suddenly have two?</h3><br/>A: We always used to only have a Gmail address and this was a good way to start out. <br/>In fact, it even came long before this website went live. <br/>But, as the Tactile Times grew and we got more publicity, we thought it was time for a more professional custom email address, and that's where info@tactiletimes.org came from.<br/>Although we still have access to both accounts and have no plans to get rid of the old Gmail address, we are slowly transitioning to our new custom address. So, if you want to get in touch, we now recommend you use the custom address as it is now tested and working.<br/>You might find it confusing that emails addressed to info@tactiletimes.com also go to us. This is just an address that forwards to our tactiletimes.org one, so there is no need to use it unless you want to give it a go for fun.<br/>If you are interested in how we can have an accessible way to receive emails from a custom address, we do it through G Suite Basic as the Google servers can easily sync to Touches, iPhones, Laptops and much more.<h3>Q. What happens if the subscription form doesn't appear or work?
