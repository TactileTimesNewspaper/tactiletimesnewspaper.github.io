Contribute an article
</h1>
<p>
If you are a young person who is blind or visually impaired and uses braille as your main way to read and write you are welcome to contribute an article, joke or puzzle to the Tactile Times. <br/>The recommended length is 100-300 words.<br/> You can contribute anything that you think is suitable for the Tactile Times based on <a href="issues.html">past issues</a>. If you think your article is not ready to go in the newspaper yet, edit it. <br/> Copy deadlines and publishing dates are published in the <a href="information.html">useful information</a> part of the website and on our blog and social media accounts.<br/> <br/> Once you have written your article <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> and attach your article to the email you send us in an accessible format.
<h2>What formats and styles are accessible?</h2>
Have a look at our tips below and see what you can do.
<ul>
<li>PDF's are unreadable to us</li>
<li>Images/scanns are useless as well as they are photos of print, which we can't read.</li>
<li>Word files (*.coc or *.docx are accessible to us.</li>
<li>Open text files (*.txt) will also work if you need to send us one.</li>
<li>You can always just put the article in the email message body but remember to save draft as you go so you can keep your contribution safe!</li>
<li>We can also handle contributions sent to us through other platforms (e.g. WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger) but we prefer email</li>
<li>Try to avoid tables where possible as they are difficult to translate into a braille publication.</li>
<li>If your document editor has the option to add headings, put the title of your article as Heading 2 and the different sections (if any) as Heading 3's
</ul>
