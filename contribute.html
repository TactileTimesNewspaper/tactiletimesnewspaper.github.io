    <h2 id="access">What formats and styles are accessible?</h2>
Have a look at our tips below and see what you can do.
<ul>
<li>PDF's are unreadable to us</li>
<li>Please do not send us braille files (*.brf, *.brl, *.dxb, etc) as we will put the articles into Word format first before translating the entire newspaper to braille. Do let us know if you would like specific braille formatting/braille graphics in your article and we will try our best to include them.</li>
<li>Images/scanns (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png, *.heic, *.svg and a lot more) are useless as well as they are photos of print, which we can't read.</li>
<li>Word files (*.doc or *.docx are accessible to us. Please do not send a file like *.gdoc, *.pages, etc... You can normally find an export option in your document editor (in Apple Pages, remember to klick export not share)</li>
<li>Open text files (*.txt) will also work if you need to send us one.</li>
<li>You can always just put the article in the email message body but remember to save draft as you go so you can keep your contribution safe!</li>
<li>We can also handle contributions sent to us through other platforms (e.g. WhatsApp) but we prefer email</li>
<li>Try to avoid tables where possible as they are difficult to translate into a braille publication.</li>
<li>If your document editor has the option to add headings, put the title of your article as Heading 3 and the different sections (if any) as Heading 4's</li>
<li>If you would like to write your article in <a href="https://doc.new">Google Docs</a>, please export the file into Word format before sending it to us (<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7654/how-to-export-documents-from-google-docs-to-your-computer/#:~:text=You%20can%20do%20this%20just,type%20of%20document%20it%20is.">This article</a> might help you). Please do not add our Google account as a viewer to the document as we cannot copy out the article into the Tactile Times.</li>
