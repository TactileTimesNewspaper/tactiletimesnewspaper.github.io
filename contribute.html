Contribute an article
</h1>
<p>
If you are a young person who is blind or visually impaired and uses braille as your main way to read and write you are welcome to contribute an article, joke or puzzle to the Tactile Times. <br/>The recommended length is 100-300 words.<br/> You can contribute anything that you think is suitable for the Tactile Times based on <a href="issues.html">past issues</a>. If you think your article is not ready to go in the newspaper yet, edit it. <br/> Copy deadlines and publishing dates are published in the <a href="information.html">useful information</a> part of the website and on our blog and social media accounts.<br/> <br/> Once you have written your article <a href="contact.html">Contact us</a> and attach your article to the email you send us in an accessible format.
<h2>What formats and styles are accessible?</h2>
Have a look at our tips below and see what you can do.
<ul>
<li>PDF's are unreadable to us</li>
<li>Please do not send us braille files (*.brf, *.brl, *.dxb, etc) as we will put the articles into Word format first before translating the entire newspaper to braille. Do let us know if you would like specific braille formatting/braille graphics in your article and we will try our best to include them.</li>
<li>Images/scanns (*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png, *.heic, *.svg and a lot more) are useless as well as they are photos of print, which we can't read.</li>
<li>Word files (*.doc or *.docx are accessible to us. Please do not send a file like *.gdoc, *.pages, etc... You can normally find an export option in your document editor (in Apple Pages, remember to klick export not share)</li>
<li>Open text files (*.txt) will also work if you need to send us one.</li>
<li>You can always just put the article in the email message body but remember to save draft as you go so you can keep your contribution safe!</li>
<li>We can also handle contributions sent to us through other platforms (e.g. WhatsApp) but we prefer email</li>
<li>Try to avoid tables where possible as they are difficult to translate into a braille publication.</li>
<li>If your document editor has the option to add headings, put the title of your article as Heading 3 and the different sections (if any) as Heading 4's</li>
<li>If you would like to write your article in <a href="https://doc.new">Google Docs</a>, please export the file into Word format before sending it to us (<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7654/how-to-export-documents-from-google-docs-to-your-computer/#:~:text=You%20can%20do%20this%20just,type%20of%20document%20it%20is.">This article</a> might help you). Please do not add our Google account as a viewer to the document as we cannot copy out the article into the Tactile Times.</li>
