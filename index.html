<h2>Top Tips for lockdown</h2><br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>Learn a piece of music (e.g. somewhere over the rainbow) to play during clap for carers</li> <li>Make things</li> <li>Stay active. It's easy enough to work out at home and it keeps us moving so we don't spend our days in bed.</li> 
<li>Stay in contact with people as much as possible. Stay in physical contact with the people you're with and stay connected with others online.</li>
<li>Keep doing the things that matter to you</li> <li> Play in the garden (if you have one)</li> <li> We're all in this together so talking about how you feel to someone else might help.</li>
<li> Lockdown doesn't mean no birthday. You could go quite a walk, organise a group call or bake a cake.</li>
