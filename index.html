Introduction
</h2>
<a name="intro"></a>
<p>
Welcome to  the homepage of the Tactile Times website! You can find out about all the latest news for young braillists here, as well as subscribe, contribute and get in touch with us.<br/>We have published three issues so far aiming to keep young braillists throughout the UK and beyond updated with articles about fun things to do, technology, sport, events and much more. During lockdown, we also sent out weekly events updates to give our subscribers one place they could go to for a list of the events happening each week. We also updated the website often with the latest events information. To view what our homepage was like in lockdown, just <a href="archive-index.html">click here</a>!

<br/> We are run by young braillists and our content is aimed at young braillists. We realised there were  no newspapers directly aimed at young braillists and this is why we set up the Tactile Times. <br/> To find out more About us check out our <a href="about.html">About us page.</a>
If you are visiting this website for the first time, you might find the <a href="#start">Where to start</a> section of this page helpful.
<h2>Subscribing and contributing</h2>
Anyone can subscribe to the newspaper via the <a href="subscribe.html">subscription form</a> on this website or by contacting us, and it is completely free to subscribe to both the electronic and hard copy braille versions.
<br/>We use Google forms for our subscription and feedback forms, and it is very accessible and easy to use. If one of our forms doesn't work, try clicking the link to complete it inGoogle forms (if available).<br/>
To contribute, you must be a young braillist (a young blind or visually impaired person (VIP) who has at least some experience of braille).<br/>
