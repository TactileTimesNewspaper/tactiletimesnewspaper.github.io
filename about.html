About Us

<img src="https://images.cm.archant.co.uk/resource/responsive-image/4801604/article-lead-image/xs/1/tactile-times-team.jpg" alt="A picture of the Three editors, Ellie, Lexy and Theo at an editorial meeting before Covid."
title="The three editors, Ellie, Lexy and Theo, at an editorial meeting." loading="lazy"</img>

<p>We are a newspaper edited by braillists for braillists. There are 3 editors <br/> If you are a young blind or visually impaired person we recommend you subscribe for all the latest news. <br/> We are 3 blind children, Ellie, Lexy and Theo, who thought it would be fun to setup a newspaper for people who are blind.
<h2 id="whatsInTtn">
What's in the newspaper
</h2>
In the newspaper, there are several sections including Events coming up, Tech, Jokes and Sport. We have made it easy to navigate within the newspaper, you just find == to go to the next article or +++ to go to the next section. Each section is also numbered.<br/> To browse the current issue of the Tactile Times Newspaper, click <a href="issues">here</a> to go to our issues page.
<h3 id="whyTtn">
Why have we made the Tactile Times?
</h2>
We have made the Tactile Times Newspaper so young braillists (aka young school-age blind and visually impaired people) can access all the events coming up and latest news in one place rather than having to go to several websites to find this information. We felt that there was a gap that had to be filled, as there was no newspaper specifically for young braillists, until the Tactile Times was created.<br/>
The Tactile Times was particularly helpful for keeping people together during the various Covid lockdowns over the last two years. <br/> If you would like more information, feel free to browse our <a href="faqs">FAQs</a> or, if they don't answer your question, get in touch with us <a href="contact">here.</a>
Although the newspaper is mainly aimed at young braillists, anyone is allowed to subscribe. However, you need to be a young braillist to <a href=""contribute">Contribute an article</a>.

<h2 id="whenTtnFormed">
  When was the Tactile Times formed?
</h2>
The Tactile Times was formed in 2018 and our first issue was published in August 2018. At that point we only had a Gmail address, and no website.<br/>Originally, we had to try and find potential new subscribers at events and other physical occations. Since then, a lot has happened.<br/>
In 2019, this website was created, giving young braillists the opportunity to find out about us through a basic, fully-accessible website. At that time it had just the one issue, and four pages.<br/>
Covid lockdowns really brought the Tactile Times to life in a major way, inspiring us to create several more pages on our website and publish several more issues and updates throughout the lockdowns.

<h2 id="articlesAboutTtn">Publicity</h2>
There are now a few articles online about the Tactile Times that introduce it in a way that may be helpful for new visitors to this website. <br/>Links to them can be found on our <a href="publicity">publicity page</a> .

<h2>Sports</h2>
We run a <a href="ttnfpl">Fantasy football league and a <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/tactiletimes">Strava club</a> for anyone who is interested in joining. These are a great way for interested young braillists to compare their scores.
<br/>There are some major differences between the two, so here is a table comparing the differences.
