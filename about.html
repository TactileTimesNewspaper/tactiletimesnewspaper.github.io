About Us
</h1><p>We are a newspaper edited by braillists for braillists. There are 3 editors <br/> If you are a young blind or visually impaired person we recommend you subscribe for all the latest news. <br/> We are 3 blind children, Ellie, Lexy and Theo, who thought it would be fun to setup a newspaper for people who are blind.
<h2>
